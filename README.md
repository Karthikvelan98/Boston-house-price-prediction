### Project Overview

---
This project aims to predict housing prices in the Boston area using machine learning techniques. The demand for housing is a crucial factor influencing the economy, and accurate price prediction models can benefit various stakeholders, including home buyers, property investors, and housebuilders. By understanding the valuation of houses in the current market, these stakeholders can make informed decisions regarding property investments and purchases.

## Data Sources
---
The primary dataset used for this analysis is the "Boston.csv" file, which contains the information about all the metrics required for the house price prediction.

### Tools
---
- Jupyter Notebook - Data cleaning, EDA

### Data Cleaning/Preparation
---
In the initial data preparation phase, I performed the following tasks:
1. Data loading and inspection
2. Handling missing values

### Exploratory Data analysis
---
EDA was used to explore questions, such as:

- What are the main features that correlate with housing prices?
- How do housing prices vary geographically across different neighborhoods or zones in Boston?
- What is the impact of house age and construction year on housing prices?
- Are there any outliers or anomalies in the housing price data?

### Results/Findings
---
In this project, I successfully developed a predictive model using machine learning to estimate housing prices in Boston. The Random Forest Regressor emerged as the final model due to its accuracy and performance. The insights derived from this model can guide potential buyers and investors in making informed decisions regarding property purchases and investments.

### Recommendations: 
---
- At least 50% of Boston towns lack zoned lands for large lots (25,000 sq ft).
- Houses located away from the Charles River are generally less expensive; however, prices increase with the number of rooms.
- Many owner-occupied houses built before 1940 are situated near employment centers with high oxide concentration.
